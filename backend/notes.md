# Yes, when a user visits a website that uses cookies to store tokens, the browser automatically sends those tokens to the server **if certain conditions are met**. Here's how it works:

1. **Cookie Creation:** When a user successfully logs in or performs an action that generates an authentication token, the server sets a cookie on the user's browser. This cookie typically contains the token and other relevant information.

2. **Cookie Inclusion in Requests:** Whenever the user's browser makes subsequent requests to the same website (or a website within the same domain), it automatically includes all relevant cookies associated with that domain in the request header.

3. **Server-Side Retrieval:** The server receives the HTTP request containing the cookies. It extracts the token and other information from the cookies and uses them for various purposes:
   - **Authentication:** The server can verify the token's validity to identify the user and determine their access rights.
   - **Session Management:** The token can be used to link the user's current session with their previous actions.
   - **Personalization:** Token data can be used to personalize the user's experience based on their preferences.

**Frontend Developer Involvement (Optional):**

In most cases, the frontend developer doesn't need to explicitly send the tokens to the server. The browser's automatic cookie handling takes care of that. However, there are some scenarios where the frontend might be involved:

- **Cross-Origin Requests:** If the website uses a separate domain for authentication (e.g., a login server), the browser might not send cookies by default due to security restrictions. The frontend developer might need to implement techniques like CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to allow cookies to be sent across domains.
- **Custom Token Handling:** In some rare cases, a frontend developer might choose not to rely on cookies and instead store tokens in local storage (e.g., localStorage) or session storage. In such cases, they would need to write custom JavaScript code to send the tokens to the server in the request headers or body.

**Overall:**

For most web applications that use cookies for token storage, the browser's automatic cookie handling ensures that tokens are sent to the server with every request, streamlining the authentication and authorization process.
